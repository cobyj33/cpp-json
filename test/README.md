# json test/ directory

A directory containing testing data, testing data sources, and a simple
command line JSON testing program.

tester.cpp is a simple file which tests the parsing, reserialization, and
reparsing of any JSON files or JSON strings passed into it. It then prints
the results to stdout and the errors to stderr.
